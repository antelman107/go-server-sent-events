## TODO
 - allow multiple client connections (it is the only one connection currently)
   - must have subscribers storage
   - add/remove subscribers
   - remove subscriber on disconnect
 - graceful start/stop
 - minimalistic public interface (require only necessary data, such as request.Context().Done() channel, http.ResponseWriter)
 - add tests and benchmarks
